DisVM Project
========================

The DisVM project is a re-implementation of the [Dis virtual machine specification](http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/dis.html) that defined the user space of the [Inferno OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(operating_system)). The Inferno OS was designed to re-hash the ideas in the [Plan 9 from Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) operating system but implemented using a platform-agnostic language. The Dis virtual machine was intrinsic to the Inferno OS and ran the byte-code compiled [Limbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbo_(programming_language)) language. This meant that only the Inferno OS need be ported to a platform and all Limbo compiled applications would 'just-work'. If this sounds familiar, it should. Inferno OS was developed in the early 90's and [project Oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_(programming_language)) - what would become Java - was being developed by Sun Microsystems. The major difference between the two approaches was that Oak's virtual machine would be ported to various platforms and work with the host OS, whereas the Dis virtual machine was tied to Inferno OS which meant there was yet another layer between the host and the Dis virtual machine. This decision had advantages, but also had the large disadvantage of requiring an entire separate OS to run Limbo code.

This project's intent is to take the Java approach and provide an implementation of the Dis virtual machine that is separate from any OS, including the Inferno OS. The project is written in C++ - using only the standard library where possible - and is intended to support compilation on any platform that has a conforming [C++ 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11) compiler. At present various modules written in Limbo (even the official Limbo compiler) have been verified to run successfully using this implementation. Some precompiled byte-code modules (`.dis` extension) have been provided in the [Downloads](https://bitbucket.org/linuxuser27/disvm/downloads) section.

Current Implementation Notes:

  * Only parts of the built-in [`Sys`](http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/man/2/sys-0intro.html) and [`Math`](http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/man/2/math-0intro.html) modules have been written
  * The `disvm-exec` project does not support the original [`Command`](http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/man/2/command.html) entry module since the official [`Draw`](http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/man/2/draw-0intro.html) module is not currently supported. Instead the entry point is defined by `limbo/Exec.m`.

# Components

This section contains implementation details on DisVM components.

### Garbage Collection - `src/vm/garbage_collector.cpp`

The Dis virtual machine specification described a hybrid garbage collection mechanism that utilized reference counting and a [concurrent mark-and-sweep algorithm](http://doc.cat-v.org/inferno/concurrent_gc/). The purpose of the hybrid approach was to mitigate cases where reference counting fails (e.g. cyclic references). The algorithm in this project fully implements reference counting, but at present has a na√Øve synchronous mark-and-sweep implementation.

It has been observed during usage of the Limbo compiler running in DisVM, that the mark-and-sweep implementation has a 20 - 25 % performance impact. This is clearly unacceptable for a modern virtual machine implementation, but was written to satisfy the current needs of the virtual machine as a learning tool. Even though the current mark-and-sweep implementation has poor performance characteristics, the original reason for it was cyclical references, so if data structures are written so these types of references don't or can't exist, reference counting will suffice. The option to disable the mark-and-sweep garbage collector is exposed as a flag on the `disvm-exec` program or if consumed directly - during instantiation of the VM.

This component can also be replaced with a custom implementation if the DisVM is consumed as a library.

### Scheduler - `src/vm/scheduler.cpp`

The DisVM default scheduler supports utilization of 1 to 4 system threads, which is useful if parallelism is desired at runtime. The current default is for the scheduler to use 1 system thread, but this can be altered from the `disvm-exec` command line or programmatically.

Like the garbage collector, this component can also be replaced with a custom implementation.

### Just-In-Time compilation

There is currently no support for the JIT compilation described in the Dis virtual machine specification.

# Build instructions

Requirements

* [C++ 11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/history) compliant compiler.
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) &ndash; minimum is 3.20.

1. `build.cmd generate (Debug|Release)?`
